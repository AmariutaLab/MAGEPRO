# MAGEPRO (Multi-Ancestry Gene Expression PRediction Optimization) 

MAGEPRO is a predictive genetics method to create powerful gene expression prediction models for populations that are underrepresented in genetic studies. We leverage eQTL summary statistics from diverse ancestries optimize our gene models and enable the identification of ancestry-specific genetic regulators of disease.
