# MAGEPRO (Multi-Ancestry Gene Expression Prediction Regularized Optimization) <img src = images/veigar.png width="50" height="50"> <img src = images/wand.png width="50" height="50">
MAGEPRO is a predictive genetics method to create powerful gene expression prediction models for populations that are underrepresented in genetic studies. We leverage eQTL summary statistics from diverse ancestries to optimize our gene models and enable the identification of novel gene-trait associations through transcriptome-wide association studies.
